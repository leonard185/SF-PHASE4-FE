hello, zaki here.
so when you pull this from the repo, dont create another vite project as there'll be duplicates and also well be bound to have severe conflicts.

Also for the styles each individual feature style should be in the style folder. so the linking of the styles will like so  "  ../src/styles/feat.css ",
This will reduce cluttered files all over the folder

If at any point you create a folder reach out to your teammates to let them know.

So work with the skeleton thats there so that merging will be smooth and even then, conflicts will be much easier to resolve!

The prog.txt is the dependencies there so when you add another dependencie feel free to put in the command
" pip freeze > prog.txt"
so that when you push your work we can install all of them right from that prog.txt file.

God-speed coding guys!!
